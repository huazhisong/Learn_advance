Canada was expected to announce\\nsimilar investments in its 2023 budget in order to remain\\ncompetitive with its southern neighbour.[6]\\nOn 22 June 2023, all parts of the budget received Royal assent,\\nand became law.[7]\\nThe budget included $43B in net new spending over six years,[8]\\nincluding $20B for a new 15 per cent refundable tax credit to\\npromote investment in green technologies.[9] $13B was also\\nallocated to implement a means-tested dental care program, a\\npolicy originating in the NDP-Liberal deal of 2022.[8] The Canadian Dental Care Plan began rollout in\\nDecember 2023.[10]\\nThe budget introduced a \"grocery rebate\" of up to $467 for eligible families and up to $234 for eligible\\nsingle people with no kids. The Canada Student Grants also saw a 40% increase in funding.[11]\\nFreeland issued $15B of spending cuts, achieved by defunding public services and cancelling\\npreviously announced programs.[12] A new tax 2% on stock buybacks was also introduced.[11]\\nBackground\\nMeasures\\nHousing\\n6/19/24, 1:59 PM 2023 Canadian federal budget - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_federal_budget 1/4'"
